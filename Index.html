    <h2 id="first">My First Blog Post</h2>
    <p> This is the first paragraph of my blog post. I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you all. In this post, I will
        be talking about my day</p>
    <p> Let's start with my morning. I woke up early and had a cup of coffee. Then, I decided to go for a walk in the park. It was a
        beautiful sunny day, and the birds were singing. I saw many people walking their dogs and children playing. It was very
        refreshing.</p>
